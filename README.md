# School project Tic-Tac-Toe (2017)

This project was made in 2017 during my studies in BTS SIO.
The code, the quality and the relevance of this project should be placed in their context. Today I can produce a better code with better technologies.

These technologies were keeped for historical reasons.

## Technologies

* Styles : Tachyons 4.12
* JavaScript : JQuery 3.5.1
* Bundler : Gulp 4

## Purpose

A page showing what is the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

A page for playing Tic-Tac-Toe (an old script I produced).

## Launch

Launch `index.html` file, assets were compiled and versionned in this repository (bad !).
